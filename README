A simple bot created to facilitate changing servers from LAN to NA/NA to LAN and maintain native. (In the case you'd like to maintain english on LAN, it will)
You can set the bot to change your username automatically by adding the information and check the box right next to "SetLanAccount" button. (This will ensure you'd like to change the username when clicking the server to use).

Planning on adding more features in the future. 
Any bugs report them on issues section. 

To install the bot simply download Setup.msi file. Only compatible with windows.
